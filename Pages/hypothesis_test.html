        <p> I believed you being on this page means you already have good knowledge of how to <a href="how_to _write_hypothesis.html">write null and alternative hypothesis</a> , <a href="How_to_calculate_the_Zstatistics.html">claculate the Z</a> and <a href="How-to-calculate-the-critical-value.html">check the critical value from the table</a>. If there is anyone you don't know yet, you are advised to click on the link to read them before continue reading on this page. <br>
        So before we start doing hypothesis test with different example if is important to know the rejection rule.</p> 

       <p class="h5"> How to make decision Using Rejection Rule. </p>
<p>To make your decision on the null hypothesis is within the following three rules</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Rule1:</b> if the alternative hypothesis is written with greater than then reject the null hypothesis if and only if the Zstatistics is greater than the Z-value gotten from the statistical table i.e. the critical value.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Rule2:</b> if the alternative hypothesis is written with less than then reject the null hypothesis if and only if the Zstatistics is less than the Z-value gotten from the statistical table i.e. the critical value.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Rule3:</b> if the alternative hypothesis is written with equal to then Reject the null hypothesis if and only if the absolute value of the Zstatistics is greater than the Z-value gotten from the statistical table i.e. the critical value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: before you do comparison you must let your Z-value from table correspond with the Z-statistic i.e. negate the Z-value whenever your Z-statistics is negative value before you do the comparison.
Now that you have learned all the important procedure let’s take a look at some examples</p>

          In the population, the average IQ is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. A team of scientists want to test a new medication to see if it has either a positive or negative effect on intelligence, or not effect at all. A sample of 30 participants who have taken the medication has a mean of 150. Did the medication affect intelligence?

Past research data from a period of over several years states that the average life expectancy of whales is 85 years. A researcher at a laboratory wishes to test this hypothesis. To that end, they procure a sample of the life spans of 35 whales. If the mean and standard deviation of the 40 whales is 90 and 2.5 respectively is the past research still right at 1% level of significant?

The hypothesis statement here is clear. The question state we should test that mean lifetime is 506days that means we will have the following as our hypothesis.
Null: the mean lifetime of the bulbs produced by the company is 506days<br> 
Alternative: the mean lifetime of the bulbs produced by the company is not 506days <br>

            Since the sample size (13) is less than 30 then we will need to use             T-table also it must be two tails test since the alternative test is             with no equal to sign.<br>

            Here we are dealing with proportion from two different population, It is important to note that whenever two proportion has no significance difference they must be the same i.e 0.5 or 50%.</p>

            <b>Step1.  </b><br>

            <b>Step2</b><br>
α=0.5 (whenever it is not given we use this)
             Since the sample size is up to 30 then we will need to use Z-table also it must be one tails test since the alternative test is with less than to sign.<br>
Now we need to proceed to <b>step3</b><br>
<b>Step3</b><br>
             (from first Population)
$N_1=600, smokers_1=400$<br>
$P_1=\frac{400}{600}=0.6667$<br>

$P_2=\frac{450}{900=0.5}$<br>
             Since we are dealing with two populations given the <br>proportion we need to use the fourth formula stated above.<br>
              Firstly we have to calculate the P<sub>0</sub><br>
$$P_0= \frac{n_1*P_1+n_2*P_2} {n_1+n_2}$$
$$P_0= \frac{600*0.6667+0.5*900}{900+600} = \frac{850}{1500} $$
              $$P_0=0.5667$$
$$Z_{cal}=\frac{P_1-P_2}{\sqrt{P_0(1-P_0)(\frac{1}{n1}+\frac {1}{n2})}} $$
              $$Z_cal=\frac{0.6667-0.5}{\sqrt{0.5667*(1-0.5667)(\frac{1}{600}+\frac {1}{900})}} $$

$$Z_cal=\frac{0.1667}{\sqrt{0.5667*0.433(\frac{1}{600}+\frac {1}{900})}} $$

            <li><p> A college football coach thought that his players could bench press a mean weight of 275 pounds. It is known that the
              standard deviation is 55 pounds. Three of his players thought that the mean weight was more than that amount.
              They asked 30 of their teammates for their estimated maximum lift on the bench press exercise. The data ranged from
              205 pounds to 385 pounds. The actual different weights were (frequencies are in parentheses) 205(3); 215(3); 225(1);
            241(2); 252(2); 265(2); 275(2); 313(2); 316(5); 338(2); 341(1); 345(2); 368(2); 385(1).
            Conduct a hypothesis test using a 2.5% level of significance to determine if the bench press mean is more than 275
          pounds.</p></li>
