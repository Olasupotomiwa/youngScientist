          The average life of a car battery of a certain brand is six years. This information is gathered using data obtained from people who have purchased and used this brand of battery over a period of several years. A researcher at the battery company develops a new type of car battery and claims that the average life of this battery is more than six years. To determine whether this claim is true, one would need to do some hypothesis testing. 
What would be the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis for this hypothesis test? assuming the researcher claims that the average life of this battery is no more six years write the test<br>

To that end they procure a sample of life spans of several whales. What is the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis that this researcher will establish?

<b>More Explanation:</b> Here the new researcher only want to know if the statement propose is likely to be true. Since the previous research state It is 85 then opposite of that will be ‘it is not 85’.
Assuming in the question above that the researcher believes that it should more that n 85 then it should be the following:<br>

<b>H<sub>a</sub>: </b>μ > 85years</p>

          In a simple random sample of 600studens taken from a university, 400 are found to be smokers. In another simple random sample of 900 students from another university who are smokers. Write the null and alternative hypothesis out if you to test if the data indicated that there is a significant difference in the habit of smoking in the two universities.??

Whenever you were given two samples taken from two different populations what you are bound to ask is either there is a significant difference between them or not. When no significant you are trying to say they are the same. Remember how will define the null hypothesis then you will realize that without significant difference is meant for Nullhypothesis while the opposite is for an alternative.
<br>
<b>Note</b>: when there is no significance then they would have the same proportion i.e. each of them will be 0.5
<br>
<b>Null:</b> no significant i.e. the proportion is Pa=Pb
<br>
<b>alternative:</b> there is a significant difference i.e. Pa ≠Pb

<br><b>Mathematically</b>

<br><b>H0: Pa = Pb</b>

<br><b>Ha: Pa≠Pb</b><br>

          A study was conducted to compare the sexual behavior of students at the University of Ibadan and the University of Lagos. At the University of Ibadan, 200 students were interviewed and 89 said they use condoms during sexual intercourse out of 250 students in the University of Lagos, 50 used condoms. Is there a difference in the proportion?

Just like the previous question, You don’t need to stress yourself before writing the hypothesis concerning the proportion when you are only trying to know if there is a significant difference or not.
<br>
<b>Null:</b> no significant i.e. the proportion is PL=Pi= 0.5<br>

<b>Alternative:</b> there is a significant difference i.e. P<sub>l</sub> ≠P<sub>i</sub> (P<sub>l</sub> and P<sub>i</sub> represent the proportion of students that use condoms in the university of Lagos and Ibadan respectively)

<br><b>Mathematically</b>

<br><b>H0:</b> P<sub>l</sub> = P<sub>i</sub>    

<br><b>Ha:</b> P<sub>l</sub>≠P<sub>i</sub>  <br>

<li><p>an experiment with the Spring 2017 statistics class. The class was asked to write down the last two numbers of their
phone number. Then they were asked to write down their guess for the population of Morocco. The objective is to
determine if the people who wrote down numbers that were greater than or equal to 60 (last 2 digits of phone number)
had a higher estimate of Morocco’s population than those with numbers less than or equal to 40. Use a level of
significance of 0.10.
