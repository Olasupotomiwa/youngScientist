     </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p> As you have learned earlier that there are two type of hypothesis which are :<br>
          <ol>
          <li> Null hypothesis</li>
          <li>Alternative hypothesis</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>For any given question The way your hypothesis will be written depend on what you are trying to test, so we can categorized all different ways you might come across in to 4 Categories below</p>
        <ul>
<li>Category A: Test for the average of one a population</li>
<li>Category B: Test for the average of two populations.</li>
<li>Category C: Test for significant difference between means of two population.</li>
<li>Category D: Test for significant difference between  proportions of two population.</li>
</ul><br>
<p class="h5 text-center">1.1 Category A (Test for average of a population) </p>
<p>
Here, all we are going to be dealing with will be on just one population and the mean will always be our estimator. In this category your null and alternative will always look like each of the following three patterns.

      <p><b>Note:</b>equal sign never present in alternative hypothosis while it is present in all of the null hypothesis although it is mixed with less than(≤) and greater than ( ≥) in one tailed test.</p>          
      <p>. the key words that will be helping you to know the null statement are: ‘is’, ‘is equal to’, ’not less than’, ’not more than’, ‘not greater than’, ‘at least’, ‘at most’, ‘equal to’, ’more than or equal to’, ‘less than or equal to’, ’not up to’. 
Alternative hypothesis indicator are: ‘less than’, ‘greater than’, ‘not equal to’, ‘more than’, ‘is not’, ’higher than’, ‘lower than’ etc.

          The average life of a car battery of a certain brand is six years. This information is gathered using data obtained from people who have purchased and used this brand of battery over a period of several years. A researcher at the battery company develops a new type of car battery and claims that the average life of this battery is more than six years. To determine whether this claim is true, one would need to do some hypothesis testing. 
What would be the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis for this hypothesis test? assuming the researcher claims that the average life of this battery is no more six years write the test<br>

          Past research data from a period of over several years states that the average life expectancy of wh<sub>a</sub>les is 85 years. A researcher at a laboratory wishes to test this hypothesis. To that end they procure a sample of life spans of several whales. What is the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis that this researcher will establish?

The alternative hypothesis will read: ''The average life expectancy of whales is not equal to 100 years.<br>

<b>H<sub>0</sub>: </b>μ = 85years</br>
<b>H<sub>a</sub>: </b>μ ≠ 85years</br>
<b>More Explanation:</b> Here the new researcher only want to know if the statement propose is likely to be true. Since the previous research state It is 85 then opposite of that will be ‘it is not 85’.
Assuming in the question above that the researcher believes that it should more that n 85 then it should be the following:<br>
<b>H<sub>0</sub>: </b>μ = 85years</br>
<b>H<sub>a</sub>: </b>μ > 85years</p>

Here the hypothesis statement is gotten from the general score belief which is from the second to the last statement.
<br>
<b>Null:</b> the average score of these students general score in major courses is 65
<br>
<b>Alternative:</b> the average score of these students in major courses is not 65
<br>
<b>Mathematically</b>
<br>
<b>H0 : μ = 65</b>
<br>
<b>Ha: μ ≠65</b>
