<p class="h4">What is hypothesis???</p>
<p>
Hypothesis can be simply defined as a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation. In other word a hypothesis is a speculation or theory based on insufficient evidence that lends itself to further testing and experimentation. With further testing, a hypothesis can usually be proven true or false. 
Let's look at an example. My friend (James) hypothesizes to me that “the flowers I plants on my land will grow faster than flowers on your land”. She plants on my land and his land and waters each plant daily for a 3month (experiment) and proves her hypothesis true! </p>
<p>
Here, the statement made by my friend is called hypothesis.</p>
<p class="h4">What is Hypothesis testing???</p>
<p>
Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics where by an analyst test an assumption regarding a population parameter. The methodology employed by the analyst depends on the nature of the data used and the reason for the analysis.
In the example above, the experiment perform by James is actually what we called hypothesis testing.
Hypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. Such data may come from a larger population, or from a data-generating process. The word "population" will be used for both of these cases in the following descriptions.
</p>
<p>
Hypothesis testing is used to assess the likelihood of a hypothesis by using sample data.
The test provides evidence concerning the likelihood of the hypothesis, given the data.<br>
Statistical analysts test a hypothesis by measuring and examining a random sample of the population being analyzed.</p>

         <p class="h4">How Hypothesis Testing Works???</p>
     </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
In hypothesis testing, the statistician tests a statistical sample, with the aims to provide evidence to the likelihood of the null hypothesis. The test is carried out by measuring and examining a random sample of the population being analyzed. All analysts usually used a random population sample to test two different hypotheses: null and the alternative hypothesis.
</p>
<p class="h5">What is null Hypothesis??</p>
<p>
A null hypothesis is a hypothesis that says there is no statistical significance between the two variables in the hypothesis. It is the hypothesis that the researcher is trying to disprove. It is usually denoted by Ho
In the example above, null hypothesis would be something like this: There is no statistically significant relationship between the lands I used to plant the flowers and growth of the flowers.</p>
<p>
A researcher is challenged by the null hypothesis and usually wants to disprove it, to demonstrate that there is a statistically-significant relationship between the two variables in the hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="card">
     <div class="card-header ">
         <p class="h4">What Is an Alternative Hypothesis?</p>
     </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
An alternative hypothesis simply is the inverse, or opposite, of the null hypothesis. So, if we continue with the above example, the alternative hypothesis would be that “there is indeed a statistically-significant relationship between what type of land used to plant the flower and its growth. To make it more easily the following show the two hypothesis. Alternative Hypthesis is usually denoted by Ha
Null: a flower plant on my land and the one planted in James’ land will have no difference in growth rate. (Bear it in mind that null always means nothing extraordinary is going on.)</p>
<p>
<b>Alternative: </b>a flower plant on my land and the one planted in James’ land will be different in tern of growth. i.e. (the flower on James’ land will grow faster than mine). <br>
Mathematically the same Hypothesis can be written as<br>
H<sub>o</sub>: H<sub>j</sub> = Hm<br>
H<sub>a</sub> : H<sub>j</sub> > Hm (where Hj and Hm represent the mean height of James’ land plant and my land plant respectively.<br>
Note: when no indicator for alternative hypothesis use ‘not equal to ‘
<br>
</p>
<p class="h5">What are the steps to be taken for Hypothesis Testing?</p>
<p>All hypotheses can easily be tested using the following four steps:<br>
1. State the two hypotheses i.e. (Determine H0 and Ha. Remember, they are contradictory)<br>
2. Formulate an analysis plan, which only outlines how the data will be evaluated.<br>
3. Calculate the test statistic.<br>
4. Use the right table to calculate the critical value.<br>
5. Compare the calculated test statistic with the Z critical value determined by the level of significance required by the test and make a decision ( reject H0 or fail to reject H0), and write a clear conclusion using English sentences.

Is there a significant difference that the rating from play store and review websites??

<li><p>an experiment with the Spring 2017 statistics class. The class was asked to write down the last two numbers of their
phone number. Then they were asked to write down their guess for the population of Morocco. The objective is to
determine if the people who wrote down numbers that were greater than or equal to 60 (last 2 digits of phone number)
had a higher estimate of Morocco’s population than those with numbers less than or equal to 40. Use a level of
significance of 0.10.
Write the hypotheses:</p></li>

<li> <p> Marketers believe that 92% of adults in the United States own a cell phone. A cell phone manufacturer believes that number is actually lower. Write out the hypothesis if you were to test for this claim.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the following poem very well and answer the question in it.<br>
My dog has so many fleas,<br>
They do not come off with ease.<br>
As for shampoo, I have tried many types<br>
Even one called Bubble Hype<br>
Which only killed 25% of the fleas,<br>
Unfortunately I was not pleased.<br>
I've used all kinds of soap,<br>
Until I had given up hope<br>
Until one day I saw<br>
An ad that put me in awe.<br>
A shampoo used for dogs<br>
called GOOD ENOUGH to Clean a Hog<br>
guaranteed to kill more fleas.<br>
With the shampoo I gave Fido a bath<br>
and started doing the math.<br>
But I need you to write me the Hypothesis<br>
Before I can do the analysis<br>
so that I can figure out,<br>
Whether to use the new shampoo or go without?</p></li>
<li><p> A research shows that about 35% of students of university of Ibadan pass the UTME on the first trial. We want to test if more than 35% pass on the first trial. Write out the Null and alternative hypothesis for the test with correct symbols.
</p></li>
<li><p>It was claimed long ago that in a population of fish, approximately 42% are female. A test is conducted to see if, in fact, the proportion is less. State the null and alternative hypotheses.</p></li>
<li><p> Maxwizard (An analyst) claims that the probability that a person picked at random at love garden in the University of Ibadan is visiting the area to meet someone He/she loves is 0.8. You want to test to see if the claim is correct. State the null and alternative hypotheses.</p></li>
