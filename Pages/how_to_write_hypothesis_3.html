Whenever you were given two samples taken from two different populations what you are bound to ask is either there is a significant difference between them or not. When no significant you are trying to say they are the same. Remember how will define the null hypothesis then you will realize that without significant difference is meant for Nullhypothesis while the opposite is for an alternative.
<br>
<b>Note</b>: when there is no significance then they would have the same proportion i.e. each of them will be 0.5
<br>
<b>Null:</b> no significant i.e. the proportion is Pa=Pb

          A study was conducted to compare the sexual behavior of students at the University of Ibadan and the University of Lagos. At the University of Ibadan, 200 students were interviewed and 89 said they use condoms during sexual intercourse out of 250 students in the University of Lagos, 50 used condoms. Is there a difference in the proportion?

Just like the previous question, You don’t need to stress yourself before writing the hypothesis concerning the proportion when you are only trying to know if there is a significant difference or not.
<br>
<b>Null:</b> no significant i.e. the proportion is PL=Pi= 0.5<br>

<b>Alternative:</b> there is a significant difference i.e. P<sub>l</sub> ≠P<sub>i</sub> (P<sub>l</sub> and P<sub>i</sub> represent the proportion of students that use condoms in the university of Lagos and Ibadan respectively)

<br><b>Mathematically</b>

<br><b>H0:</b> P<sub>l</sub> = P<sub>i</sub>    

<br><b>Ha:</b> P<sub>l</sub>≠P<sub>i</sub>  <br>

<li><p>an experiment with the Spring 2017 statistics class. The class was asked to write down the last two numbers of their
phone number. Then they were asked to write down their guess for the population of Morocco. The objective is to
determine if the people who wrote down numbers that were greater than or equal to 60 (last 2 digits of phone number)
had a higher estimate of Morocco’s population than those with numbers less than or equal to 40. Use a level of
significance of 0.10.

<li><p>Read the following poem very well and answer the question in it.<br>
My dog has so many fleas,<br>
They do not come off with ease.<br>
As for shampoo, I have tried many types<br>
Even one called Bubble Hype<br>
Which only killed 25% of the fleas,<br>
Unfortunately I was not pleased.<br>
I've used all kinds of soap,<br>
Until I had given up hope<br>
Until one day I saw<br>
An ad that put me in awe.<br>
A shampoo used for dogs<br>
called GOOD ENOUGH to Clean a Hog<br>
guaranteed to kill more fleas.<br>
With the shampoo I gave Fido a bath<br>
and started doing the math.<br>
But I need you to write me the Hypothesis<br>
Before I can do the analysis<br>
so that I can figure out,<br>
Whether to use the new shampoo or go without?</p></li>
<li><p> A research shows that about 35% of students of university of Ibadan pass the UTME on the first trial. We want to test if more than 35% pass on the first trial. Write out the Null and alternative hypothesis for the test with correct symbols.

<li><p>It was claimed long ago that in a population of fish, approximately 42% are female. A test is conducted to see if, in fact, the proportion is less. State the null and alternative hypotheses.</p></li>
<li><p> Maxwizard (An analyst) claims that the probability that a person picked at random at love garden in the University of Ibadan is visiting the area to meet someone He/she loves is 0.8. You want to test to see if the claim is correct. State the null and alternative hypotheses.</p></li>
